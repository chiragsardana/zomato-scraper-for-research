## **What is Scraping?**

**Web scraping** is the process of **automatically collecting data from websites**. Instead of manually copying information from web pages, a program or script extracts the desired data from the HTML of the page.

### **How Scraping Works**

1. **Request the Webpage** – The scraper sends a request to the website and retrieves the HTML content.
2. **Parse the HTML** – The script reads the HTML structure and identifies the data you want (like restaurant names, ratings, or reviews).
3. **Extract Data** – Pulls the information from HTML tags or attributes.
4. **Store Data** – Saves the extracted data in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or a database.
5. **Handle Multiple Pages** – If there’s more data spread over multiple pages (like 150 reviews per restaurant), the scraper loops through all pages to collect it.

### **Ethical and Legal Considerations**

* Scraping **may violate a website’s terms of service** if done without permission, especially with automated tools.
* Even if data is publicly visible, many sites explicitly forbid automated extraction.
* Safe alternatives include:

  * Using **official APIs**
  * Using **publicly available datasets**
  * Requesting **permission from the website**
