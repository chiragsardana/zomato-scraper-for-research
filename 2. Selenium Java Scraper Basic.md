## **What is Selenium Java Scraper?**

A **Selenium Java scraper** is a program written in **Java** that uses **Selenium** to automatically collect data from websites.

* **Selenium** is a framework originally designed for **automated testing of web applications**, but it can also be used to **browse websites programmatically**.
* Unlike simple HTML parsers (like Jsoup), Selenium can handle **dynamic content**—pages where data loads with JavaScript, requires clicking buttons, or scrolling.

## **How It Works**

1. **Launch a Browser**

   * Selenium opens a real browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) or runs in **headless mode** (no GUI).

2. **Navigate to Webpages**

   * It visits the URLs you specify.

3. **Interact With the Page**

   * Selenium can **click buttons**, **scroll down**, **fill forms**, or **hover over elements**—anything a human user can do.
   * Example: clicking “Load More Reviews” to see additional reviews.

4. **Extract Data**

   * You use Selenium methods like `findElement()` or `findElements()` with **CSS selectors, XPath, or class names** to extract text or attributes.
   * Example: restaurant name, rating, cuisine, review text.

5. **Store Data**

   * Save the extracted data in **CSV, JSON, or a database**.

6. **Loop Through Multiple Pages**

   * If you need data from multiple restaurants or review pages, Selenium can loop through each link automatically.

## **Why Use Selenium for Scraping?**

* Handles **dynamic websites** that load content with JavaScript (Jsoup alone cannot).
* Can simulate **real user actions**, making it possible to extract hidden or paginated data.
* Works well with complex web interactions (popups, login forms, scrollable lists).
